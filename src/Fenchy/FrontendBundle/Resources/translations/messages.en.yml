    small_data:
      name: Small Data
      title: Small data is not watching you.
      content: Big Data is centralized data. Centralized information that can be abused to control and spam everybody with centralized information, and advertisement.  Polly & Bob aims to be small data as much as possible. Data should be on local servers. You own your data. What is erased is erased for ever. We donât encourage to post private pictures which are meant only to friends. Small data is stored locally not accesable centrally. This is still a challenge for us, please help us to make it happen.

Connect with whomever you want. Build your own ass-hole-free-zone (afz). An individual but not individualized or alone.

      content: Eyes can only meet in real life. On Polly & Bob we do clickclickclick and touch-screentouch. But we do it in order to get together offline. We say: âTake the time. Enrich your lifeâ, because we believe the human condition is about to meet and spend time with other people. We know it is easier to sit on a couch and watch. But we know also that it is much more rewarding to meet in Real life. This is what life really is about.

      name: Fun
      title: What's up around me tonight?

    access:
      name: Access
      title: So much stuff lying around unused.
      content: Millions of cars standing in the streets. So much stuff collects dust in the junk room, self storages and even living rooms of our world. Why not use it? Why do we have to own it? Everything we need is access. The 21st century will see a dramatic change in the way we consume. The economy will turn from a possession economy to an access economy. We can organize this on Polly & Bob.
