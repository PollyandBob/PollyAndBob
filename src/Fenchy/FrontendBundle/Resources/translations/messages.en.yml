    discovery:
      name: Discovery
      title: Discover your Neighborhood.
      content: Your neighborhood waits to be discovered. So many interesting people around you, that you don‘t know. So many fun things we could do together, if we would know.

    trust:
      name: Trust
      title: Whom can we trust today?
      content: What’s wrong with the world these days? So much fake, make up, stalking, fishing, spam, hidden traps and unwanted add ups to the bills. To make collaborative consumption happen, we have to rely on: „oh, don’t worry. I bring your car back tomorrow!“ On Polly & Bob we want to establish a culture of trust. We count contribution to the community in community points and we exclude trolls and abusers (the few that disturb the system) Once we trust each other we can let go more easy.

    sharing:
      name: Sharing
      title: Sharing economy on Polly & Bob.

Hire or offer talents and services in the neighborhood. Polly & Bob brings good people together.

    small_data:
      name: Small Data
      title: Small data is not watching you.
      content: Big Data is centralized data. Centralized information that can be abused to control and spam everybody with centralized information, and advertisement.  Polly & Bob aims to be small data as much as possible. Data should be on local servers. You own your data. What is erased is erased for ever. We don‘t encourage to post private pictures which are meant only to friends. Small data is stored locally not accesable centrally. This is still a challenge for us, please help us to make it happen.
    
    community:
      name: Community
      title: Create your own community.
      content: Polly & Bob is a new way of living together with the people around you. It is not the muggy and airless neighborhood we know. The New Neighborhood community doesn’t have beraucracy and fixed structures. It is fresh air and individualized. Everybody can start, everybody can join. Everybody has his own crowd and community around him. Polly & Bob communities are not bound to destricts or local areas. You can do that. Make your own local community. Connect with whomever you want. Build your own ass-hole-free-zone (afz). An individual but not individualized or alone.

    real_life:
      name: Real Life
      title: What is the human being about?
      content: Eyes can only meet in real life. On Polly & Bob we do clickclickclick and touch-screentouch. But we do it in order to get together offline. We say: ‘Take the time. Enrich your life’, because we believe the human condition is about to meet and spend time with other people. We know it is easier to sit on a couch and watch. But we know also that it is much more rewarding to meet in Real life. This is what life really is about.
    
    fun:
      name: Fun
      title: What's up around me tonight?
      content: Where is something going on now? Who is free for having a coffee? Who joins in for the football match tonight? Who wants to explore the city together? Who organizes exciting stuff on the weekend? Who is having dinner with me today? Fun, around me, any time, accessible on Polly & Bob.

    access:
      name: Access
      title: So much stuff lying around unused.
      content: Millions of cars standing in the streets. So much stuff collects dust in the junk room, self storages and even living rooms of our world. Why not use it? Why do we have to own it? Everything we need is access. The 21st century will see a dramatic change in the way we consume. The economy will turn from a possession economy to an access economy. We can organize this on Polly & Bob.
